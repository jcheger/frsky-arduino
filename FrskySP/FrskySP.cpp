/** \mainpage
 * Arduino library for Frsky Smart Port protocol.
 * 
 * This library is not designed to decode data on the transmitter, but on the receiver side. OpenTX makes the rest of
 *  the job on the transmitter.
 *
 * This development is completely independent of Frsky or OpenTX.
 * 
 * What to know about Smart Port
 * =============================
 * * use an inverted serial communication at 57600bds muxed on one port
 * * the receiver polls 27 physical sensors periodically
 * * compare to D, the SP protocol seems much faster, but maybe not - it's easier to use for data encoding, and is
 *   nicer to have a bus than a hub, but the polling of 27 IDs takes time (i.e. if a sensor has many values, it can
 *   send only one at a time, ex. GPS).
 * 
 * Receiver behavior
 * -----------------
 * The receiver polls in a cyle of (a bit more of) 11 ms.
 * 
 * byte | description
 * -----|------------
 * 0x7E | poll header
 * ID   | physical ID (1-27) computed with a CRC (see \ref FrskySP_sensor_demo/FrskySP_sensor_demo.ino for the full list of polled IDs)
 * 
 * * The receiver will poll the IDs in sequence to find which one is present.
 * * If only one physical ID is found, the receiver will alternate the sensor polling and the search (present sensor,
 *   next ID to search, present sensor, next ID and so on).
 * * If more sensors are found, the poll sequence returns almost to a normal search pattern.
 * 
 * Sensor behavior
 * ---------------
 * Genuine Frsky sensors: the sensor answers to every pool on its physical ID to announce its presence. If no data can
 * be transmitted (no refresh), the sensor answers by an empty packet and a false CRC (type 0x00, ID 0x0000,
 * value 0x00000000, CRC 0xFF).
 * 
 * Packet format
 * -------------
 * byte(s) | descrption
 * --------|-----------
 * 1       | type (only 0x10 at now)
 * 2       | sensor logical ID (see \ref FrskySP.h for the full list of IDs)
 * 4       | value
 * 1       | CRC
 * 
 * Slowness considerations
 * =======================
 * There are 2 recurrent discussions on Internet, that are related to what is used in this code and examples:
 * * SoftwareSerial is too slow - no, it is not (at least in Arduino 1.0+). The answers from the Arduino are even faster
 *   than the genuine Frksy sensors. Allthough, the annoying point is the conflict with the PinChangeInt library.
 * * Floating point computing is slow - yes and no. The slowness is reversed if the input or the output of the formula
 *   is a float. Example:
 * ~~~~~
 * int b = (int) a / 10;     // faster (a & b are integers)
 * int b = (int) a * 0.1;    // slower
 * 
 * float b = (int) a / 10;   // slower (b is a float)
 * float b = (int) a * 0.1;  // faster
 * ~~~~~
 * A float computing can take up to 40us. Unless you make a lot of them, there is plenty of time to answer within the
 * poll cycle (11 ms). Allthough, OpenTX has many computing to do and has no time to lose. There is a little drift for
 * the GPS and airspeed values shown on the remote control.
 * 
 * Anyway, you must be careful around those issues:
 * * only one sensor per physical ID (ex. GPS and normal precision altimeter share the same physical ID 3)
 * * only one answer per poll cycle (the [FrskySP_sensor_demo.ino](\ref FrskySP_sensor_demo/FrskySP_sensor_demo.ino)
 *   example shows how to handle multiple answers for one physical ID)
 * * take care about the polling time of the sensor. For instance, polling a DS18x20 temperature sensor takes up to
 *   750ms. The polling must be asynchronous to be answered within the cycle of 11ms.
 * 
 * Connection draft
 * ================
 * \image html Smart_Port_bb.png
 * 
 * * pull down resistor on TX line (22k)
 * * diode between TX and RX (ex. 1N4108)
 * 
 * On this circuit, RX will hang after serial begin. There is a workaround that inverts the TX pinMode to INPUT and back
 *  to OUTPUT.

 * \copyright 2014 - Jean-Christophe Heger - Released under the LGPL 3.0 license.
 * \ChangeLog 2014-06-27 - public devel release
 * \todo write an example to simulate an X8R receiver
 * 
 * \bug There is an unsolved bug with one value only, until now. While trying to send airspeed value 100 mph, converted
 * to knots, the receiver will not detect the sensor and not send the value to the remote neither. It works perfectly
 * with 101 or 99 mph, but 100 mph will hang.
